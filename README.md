# hello-world
This repository is for practicing GitHub Flow.

I'm learning to code from scratch much later than probably most coders today.
I'd be lying if I said it wasn't scary or daunting at times, because it most
definitely is...at times.
Still, despite the very real unique obstacles before me, I will not give up.
It's not clich√®, in my opinion, to be the late bloomer attempting to offer
hope to others in similar positions. This is my journey. I hope to learn, to
grow, and to connect with others along the way!

Peace!
Danny
